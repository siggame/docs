Documentation
-------------

Each of the plants clients has an associated documentation set. Feel free to browse!


Documentation was generated by running ``doxygen`` in each client
directory. If you'd like, you can run ``doxygen`` locally so that you
can view the docs offline. We'll miss you though.
