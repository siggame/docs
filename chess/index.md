Visualizer
----------

Visualizers are available for download. The date next to the download
indicates when it was built. It's probably a good idea to get the
latest one.

Documentation
-------------

Each of the chess clients has an associated documentation set. Feel free to browse!

Documentation was generated by running ``doxygen`` in each client
directory. If you'd like, you can run ``doxygen`` locally so that you
can view the docs offline. We'll miss you though.

### Docs

* [C++](/chess/doxygen/cpp)
* [C#](/chess/doxygen/csharp)
