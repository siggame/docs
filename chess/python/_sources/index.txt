Chess Python 3 Client
=====================

This is the root of you AI. Stay out of the joueur/ folder, it does most
of the heavy lifting to play on our game servers. Your AI, and the game
objects it manipulates are all in ``games/chess/``, with your very own
AI living in ``games/chess/ai.py`` for you to make smarter.

How to Run
----------

This client has been tested and confirmed to work on the Campus
rc##xcs213 Linux machines, but it can work on your own Windows/Linux/Mac
machines if you desire.

Linux
~~~~~

::

    ./testRun MyOwnGameSession

For Linux a recent version of ``python3`` should work. It has been
tested on 3.4.3 extensively, but sould work with >= 3.2. The normal
'python' usually refers to Python 2.7.X, so make sure you have the
python\ **3** installed.

Windows
~~~~~~~

On Windows you'll need some version of Python 3. As of this version
`3.4.3 <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-343/>`__ worked
fine. Install that and ensure that python is set up in your
Environmental Variables as 'python3', then

::

    python3 main.py Chess -s r99acm.device.mst.edu -r MyOwnGameSession

Make
----

There is a ``Makefile`` provided, but it is empty as python is an
intepreted language. If you want to add ``make`` steps feel free to, but
you may want to check with an Arena dev to ensure the Arena has the
packages you need to use in ``make``.
