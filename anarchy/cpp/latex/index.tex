This is the root of you A\-I. Stay out of the joueur/ folder, it does most of the heavy lifting to play on our game servers. Your A\-I, and the game objects it manipulates are all in {\ttfamily games/anarchy/}, with your very own A\-I living in {\ttfamily games/anarchy/ai.\-js} for you to make smarter.

\subsection*{How to Run}

This client has been tested and confirmed to work on the Campus rc\#\#xcs213 Linux machines, but it can work on your own Windows/\-Linux/\-Mac machines if you desire.

\subsubsection*{Linux}

``` make .test\-Run My\-Own\-Game\-Session ```

If you are on your own machine, make sure you've installed boost. The libboost-\/all-\/dev package should be up to date. You'll also need cmake for make to work.

\subsubsection*{Windows}

Be aware that getting this C++ client to build on Windows, while possible, can be a headache.

For Windows, Boost has a simple way to \href{http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/more/getting_started/windows.html}{\tt compile from source using bootstrap}. You'll need to do that. This client does work with V\-C++, you can create a solution at the root or ask a dev for the sln file. Just add the directory you built Boost in the Project's linker configuration. You'll also need to set command line arguments like the other clients.

\subsection*{Other notes}

The initial make step may take upwards of 2 minutes. You should see a percent progress updating on your screen, but it will be slow. Subsequent {\ttfamily make}s should be only a few seconds if you don't {\ttfamily make clean}.
